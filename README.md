## Known Issues
- Grid Fins can cause big roll oscillations if actuating with the engines, make sure to disable them on ignition
- If you're experiencing wobbly grid fins, reduce the authority limiter (inconsistent)
- Stock staging readings reads only part of cluster thrust data. Use KER or MJ instead
