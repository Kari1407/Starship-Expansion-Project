# Starship Expansion Project
Starship Expansion Project (SEP) is a mod being developed by me, Kari, and our amazing team. Our project aims to bring our intepretation of the Starship vehicle by SpaceX into Kerbal Space Program. While a lot of the design choices are based on the actual vehicle sitting on Boca Chica, creative freedom is used to expand our mod even further.

## Know Issues
- When you spawn a part in the VAB it may have invisible meshes, just click it again and will fix itself
- If SEP parts are black, you need to bump up KSP graphical settings, specifically render quality and/or reflection related settings
- Ship's aerodynamics is very sensitive, small changes to the weight distribution can cause instability, we are looking at potential *permanent* fixes
- Stock SAS tends to overcorrect a lot and can create even more instability on ship EDL (Entry, descent and landing). We recommend using MechJeb or FlyByWire SAS Mode to mitigate that.
- Full Stack is not very stable on ascent, that's a design issue, fly with flaps perpendicular to the ground and don't be too agressive on the gravity turn and you should be fine.
